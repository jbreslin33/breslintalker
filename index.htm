</h1>

<br>
<div class="imageobjectRoache"></div>
<br><br>

Every year over 50 people are given World Series Rings, about 100
SuperBowl Rings are handed out every year, one even to the guy who washes
the players underwear. Around 30 hockey players names are engraved
every year on the Stanley Cup. But at most 4 athletes a year can win
the Roache Open and get their names engraved forever on the Roache
Challenge Cup. Roache Open players also must play under the most
difficult of situations, much of it caused by self inebriation. Yet year after year
the players come back and take another shot at immortality. There are only 34
names on the Roache Challenge Cup, this year we will add 4 more. <br>
<br><br>

<h1 class="title">
Ed Tomaselli, Mike Upton and Denis Nash win 2010 Roache Open Tournament with score
of -3.
<Br>
</h1>
It wouldn't be a Roache Open without Hurricane like conditions and this tournament was no different.
For the 2nd Year in a row and 3rd in 4 years there was a major storm during the tournament. Ed Tomaselli is a mudder
though and he took down his 2nd consecutive Roache Open Tournament with the help of Mike Upton and Denis Nash who won
his 2nd Career Title. This year was an especially close year with most of the 13 teams under par and several right behind
the winners at -2. We would like to thank our score keepers, beer girls, Johnny Good Times for filming it, Heather Platt for organizing the event and Kevin and the Rest
of the John F. Byrne Staff for accomadating us.


<BR><br>

<div class="imageobject2010a"></div>

-------------------------------------------

<h1 class="title">
John Bauer, Ed Tomaselli, Blaise Reifer and Dave Breslin win 2009
Roache Open with best score in tournament history(-5). <Br>
</h1>
Roache Open 9 started out with rain and thunder. 50 Roache Openers
waited in the clubhouse drinking, playing poker and smoking cigars.
Then suddenly the weather broke like the green on the 4th hole.
We were able to get off the traditional Roache Open Draft to even
out the teams. Carts though were out the question. We would have to
walk the course with golf bags on our shoulders.
Spurred on either by their guts, alcohol or fear of Beer Girl
Erin Callahan calling them a pussy the Roache Openers marched the
course and did not complain.

<div class="imageobject"></div>
<br><br>
It was a most impressive display by all the golfers to slog thru the
course with bags over their shoulders and beers in hand.
The creeks that run thru the course were overflowing almost
onto the fairways. The Beer girls Daniela D'Ambrosio(Chainsaw) and
Erin Callahan(Ace)were spectacular and probably
responsible for keeping a few golfers from packing it in.

<br><br>
Briana Pietropaula and friend Morgan filmed the whole event and we
will be posting video of that when we get it.
<br><br>

John Bauer was the drafter for the winning team but was not their
for the draft as he was delayed by the weather so his team was
automatically selected for him by taking the best available player.
That turned out to be Ed Tomaselli who a few drafters passed over.

<br><br>

Right after the draft Ed Tomaselli went down to his assigned starting hole
and asked if anyone there was John Bauer or was on John Bauer's team.
Up stepped Dave Breslin to let Ed know that they were both on John's
team. Ed Tomaselli took a look at Dave Breslin's 2 Nike Batting
gloves and thought "not a good sign". Then things took a turn for
the worse as someone who looked like a badly dressed back street boy
stepped up and said. "Yo, you on Cups team too, Yo we teammates, Imma
gonna get my drive on today, Yo." This was his newest teammate Blaise Reifer.
At this point Tomaselli is wondering
what the hell he just got himself into and starting hoping that this John Baur guy
would just be normal. John Baur was more than normal that day he was
exceptional and led his team to the lowest score in the 10 year history
of the Roache Open. All this under difficult playing conditions.
