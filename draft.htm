		<h1 class="title">The Draft: <br> </h1>

		The drafters/captains will be ranked and described by Jim Roache, Rob Pietropaula, Jim Breslin and a 'Consensus'. If you wish
		to be a part of the 'consensus' email me changes
		or comments to jbreslin33@gmail.com. We would value greatly your serious or funny comments about yourself or others.<br> <br>


        The Draft Order will be as follows:<br>
        1st pick in 1st round goes to the worst ranked captain.
        Last pick in 1st round goes to the best ranked captain.<br><br>
        After the first round we will reseed for the 2nd round using the following method:<br>
        Add the ranks of the captain and their first round choice. Whichever team
        has the highest number will draft first, lowest number will draft last.
        <br><br>
        After the 2nd round we will reseed for the 3rd and final round using the following method:<br>
        Add the ranks of the captain and their 1st and 2nd round choice. Whichever team
        has the highest number will draft 1st, lowest number will draft last.

        <br><br><b>
        If your team only has 3 players you will not be given extra shots. <br>
        If you want to have a guarantee of having a 4th player than make sure you <br>
        take one the lesser ranked 2nd round players that will give you a higher 3rd
        round pick. Obviously those who take a high ranked 2nd rounder have a chance of not
        having a 3rd round player but they can take solice in the fact that they have a high
        ranked 2nd rounder.</b><br><br>
