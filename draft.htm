		<h1 class="title">The Draft: <br> </h1>

		The drafters/captains will be ranked and described by Jim Roache, Rob Pietropaula, Jim Breslin and a 'Consensus'. If you wish
		to be a part of the 'consensus' email me changes
		or comments to jbreslin33@gmail.com. We would value greatly your serious or funny comments about yourself or others.<br> <br>


        The Draft Order will be as follows:<br>
        1st pick in 1st round goes to the worst ranked captain.
        Last pick in 1st round goes to the best ranked captain.<br><br>
        After the first round we will reseed for the 2nd round using the following method:<br>
        Add the ranks of the captain and their first round choice. Whichever team
        has the highest number will draft first, lowest number will draft last.
        <br><br>
        After the 2nd round we will reseed for the 3rd and final round using the following method:<br>
        Add the ranks of the captain and their 1st and 2nd round choice. Whichever team
        has the highest number will draft 1st, lowest number will draft last.

        <br><br><b>
        If your team only has 3 players you will not be given extra shots. <br>
        If you want to have a guarantee of having a 4th player than make sure you <br>
        take one the lesser ranked 2nd round players that will give you a higher 3rd
        round pick. Obviously those who take a high ranked 2nd rounder have a chance of not
        having a 3rd round player but they can take solice in the fact that they have a high
        ranked 2nd rounder.</b><br><br>

Consensus Rankings (Updated 7/17/2009 12:48am) <br> <br>

<br><br>
We are atleast 18 deep with under 100 shooters. Meaning if everyone just played
Byrnes by themselves that day I would say on average 18 would post scores under a 100.
We have 18 players who are claiming current games in the 90's and atleast 5 more that
would teater on the border and a couple more with an outside shot.

         without a rank have not confirmed they are in yet.****************

<b>1 Jim Breslin </b><BR>
<img src="images/jimbreslin.jpg" alt="Jim Breslin."
  align="left"><BR>
<b>Former Winner(2007)</b>
Playing in the low 80's and high 70's at John F. Byrne. Strategy for tournament
revolves completely around avoiding picking Jim Roache at all costs. Training like
I was Rocky before he fought Drago, running up hills with 3 golf bags strapped to my
back with a five iron clenched in my teeth and chasing chickens around the putting green.
Plan on studying film by watching Caddyshack. Currently being coached by his 'Sense'
Mike Murrin.
<BR clear="left">
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b>2 Nick Prosperi</b><BR>
<img src="images/caddyshack3.jpg" alt="Nick Prosperi."
  align="left"><BR>
<b>Former Winner(2001,2005)</b>
Always drafts first and still led 2 teams to titles, 2001,2005,consistent,solid, waiting for scouting
report from nick so i can adjust. According to Tim Roache Nick is a notch above himself.
<BR clear="left">
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b>3 Tim Roache </b><BR>
<img src="images/caddyshack11.jpg" alt="Tim Roache."
  align="left"><BR>
<b>Former Winner(2000,2004)</b>
Captained 2 teams to titles,2000,2004, waiting for his scouting report on how he's shooting and
will adjust accordingly by a few spots. Recently shot an 84 at John F. Byrne(par 67) and and a 90 at
a par 70.
<BR clear="left">
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b>4 Mike Murrin(Mibes)</b><BR>
<img src="images/mikemurrin.jpg" alt="Mike Murrin."
  align="left"><BR>
<b></b>
Just as annoying as he is good, and he is very annoying, which means he is very good.
If he is on you could easily ride him to a championship. Just shot an 89 at Byrne but
is easily capable of low 80's or high 70's. He is still on Double Secret
Probation from a violation in 2002. He still remains ranked high as a re-instatement penalty.
Mike also has a restraining order against him. He is not allowed within 10ft
of a scoring pencil. If you get drafted by Mike my advice to you is to start
drinking heavily.
<BR clear="left">
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b>5 John Bauer(Cups)</b><BR>
<img src="images/johnbauer.jpg" alt="John Bauer(Cups)"
  align="left"><BR>
<b>Former Winner (2005)</b>
Will put the ball in the 'Cup' for you. Need to know how he is shooting or
if he is so I can move him up,down. Just shot a 90 at course that translates to
mid 80's at Byrne.
<BR clear="left">
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b>6 John from Glam	 </b><BR>
<img src="images/glam.jpg" alt="Bob."
  align="left"><BR>
<b></b>
Moving Big John up 15 slots based on his round
of 84 and an Eagle at John F. Byrne. Former 90's shooter has found his stroke
and is on a hot streak. Don't want to move him too high too quick but this spot
seems about right.
<BR clear="left">
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b>7 Ed Bell (Kim O'Shea's Fiance)</b><BR>
<img src="images/caddyshack8.jpg" alt="Michelle"
  align="left"><BR>
<b></b>
Kim O'Shea says he's shooting in the 90's. Can on rare occassion dip into the
80's.
<BR clear="left">
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b>8 Edward O'Brien(Pony)</b><BR>
<img src="images/edobrien.jpg" alt="Edward O'Brien(Pony)"
  align="left"><BR>
<b>Former Winner (2003,2005)</b>
Lefthanded, looks like ralph macchio, has a similiar golf game. You could make an argument to
rank him higher and he still might be if he gets out at all this year. Just shot a
90 something at cobb which would put him atleast low 90's at Byrne.
<BR clear="left">
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b>9 Mark Dlutowski(Marky D)</b><BR>
<img src="images/caddyshack2.jpg" alt="Mark Dlutowski"
  align="left"><BR>
<b></b>
Eccentric player uses clubs from 1906, if mark has gotten out this year we will
move him up. waiting on report from Mark. We always rank Mark very high based
on his golfing performances of 20 years ago which was probably unfair.
We are taking some of the pressure off him this year. Got an update from Mark
he says put him down for low to mid 90's. Mark used to live right down the street
from Byrne so I sure he already Byrnes adusted his scores.
<BR clear="left">
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b>10 Jason Kemner</b><BR>
<img src="images/caddyshack8.jpg" alt="Jason Kemner"

<b>11 Chris Davis(Wink) 	 </b><BR>
<img src="images/chrisdavis.jpg" alt="Chris Davis"
  align="left"><BR>
<b>Defending Roach Open Champion. Former Winner(2002,2003)</b>
Captained 2003 team to victory at Middletown. Makes Kenny Nolan seem cheerful,
can read greens like an idiot savant.Their is no debating Chris Davis's talent,
he has shot in the high seventies, the problem comes from him only playing
once a year now with a bad back. Probably would have difficulty scoring by himself
but is an extremely valuable best ball player even only playing once a year. Just shot
a 107 at Byrne but swung the club well he just kept over or undershooting the green but
his balls were right on target. Needs a few rounds to get his feel back and he could
drop his score precipitously and be very dangerous, stock going up.
<BR clear="left">
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b>12 Kenny Nolan</b><BR>
<img src="images/caddyshack4.jpg" alt="Kenny Nolan"
  align="left"><BR>
<b>Former Winner (2002)</b>
He's like a Pint of Guiness, Irish and bitter but very good. Hasn't golfed or
hit the range. Stock going down but not too far.
<BR clear="left">
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b>13 Ed Tomaselli</b><BR>
<img src="images/caddyshack8.jpg" alt="Ed Tomaselli"
  align="left"><BR>
<b></b>
Last time out shot a 96 at Byrne. I Talked to him he normally shoots in the low 90's.
<BR clear="left">

************************ 1st Rounders **********************<Br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b>14 Robert Miller</b><BR>
<img src="images/robertmiller.jpg" alt="Robert Miller"
  align="left"><BR>
<b></b>
 His brother is a pro Golfer. This gives him
just enough pedigree to move him up from last year. Ability to hit close to
pin from 50 yards and in with nice wedge shot. Capable of shooting in the low 90's.
<BR clear="left">
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b>15 John Austin</b><BR>
<img src="images/caddyshack3.jpg" alt="Uncle John."
  align="left"><BR>
<b></b>
Wiley golf veteran. Moving him back based on other players
getting better and that he will probably try to draft his nephews Stepen Pietropala
and Jamie Magee(see below). Just shot a 98 at Island Green which is a tough course,
that score translates to atleast low 90's at Byrne. John says this is about typical
of what he shoots.
<BR clear="left">
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b>16 Joe Chic</b><BR>
<img src="images/caddyshack4.jpg" alt="John Breslin"
  align="left"><BR>
<b></b>
Need a scouting report from Joe Chic. Got one, Joe shoots in the 90's usually.
<BR clear="left">
--------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b>17 Rob Pietropaula </b><BR>
<img src="images/robpietropaula.jpg" alt="Rob Pietropaula."
  align="left"><BR>
<b>Defending Roache Open Champ. Former Winner (2003, 2008)</b>
Rob as the captain of the defending championship team is automatically drafting.
Lefthanded,cocky,shaved his magic mustache. Shown on left wearing the Roache Open Trophy.
Former perrenial #2 was a first time drafter last year and came through big time by captaining
his Roache Open Team to Victory last year, moving him up accordingly. If Rob shoots in the 80's
we will move him up, right now he is shooting in the mid 90's). Just shot a 98 at Byrne.
Has been shooting mid to high 90's consistently.
<BR clear="left">
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b>18 Kim O'Shea</b><BR>
<img src="images/caddyshack6.jpg" alt="Kim O'Shea"

I've gotten an update from Kim and she is now shooting in the 90's.
<BR clear="left">
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b>19 Michelle Forrest</b><BR>
<img src="images/caddyshack7.jpg" alt="Michelle"
  align="left"><BR>
<b></b>
Starting playing last year but is pretty good. Scouting report from her friend
Kim is that she is shooting in the 90's.
<BR clear="left">
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b>20 Paul Sholette</b><BR>
<img src="images/caddyshack10.jpg" alt="Paul Sholette"
  align="left"><BR>
<b></b>
Could help extra by using his engineering skills
to calculate distance using the sun,flag,ball and Pythagorean Theorem. Putting paul
as a drafter so he can draft Dave Klatchko his friend. Before anyone complains
this is a disadvantage to Paul and his team as Paul would normally be ranked
around 19th or 20th.
<BR clear="left">
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b>21 Dave Klatchko</b><BR>
<img src="images/caddyshack10.jpg" alt="Dave Klatchko"
  align="left"><BR>
<b></b>
Shoots about a 100 which is probably under a 100 at a place like John F. Byrne.
<BR clear="left">
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b>22 Dennis Nash </b><BR>
<img src="images/caddyshack9.jpg" alt="Dennis Nash"
  align="left"><BR>
<b>Former Winner(2002)</b>
If Kenny doesn't show up he's
the best Irishman in the Tourny, whatever that means. Shooting around 100 currently.
<BR clear="left">
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b>23 Big Outside Jim</b><BR>
<img src="images/caddyshack4.jpg" alt="Robert from Glam"
  align="left"><BR>
<b></b>
Will take brake from sitting outside plough to attend tournament. Says he could
shot anywhere from a 95 to 125.
<BR clear="left">
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b>24 Jim Roache </b><BR>
<img src="images/jimroache.jpg" alt="Jim Roache"
  align="left"><BR>
<b>Former Winner (2000,2001,2004)</b>
Venerable founder of the Roache Open Tournament.Uses a 7-iron for every
shot,plays small ball, ironically also has very small balls. Stock is
dropping faster than one of his duffed tee shots. His swing looks like
a retarded, drunk monkey trying to whack his own tail with a seven iron.
At this stage of his long career he is nothing more than a specialty player.
Has no long game to speak of but has good short game around the green and in
the bedroom. I Can not believe I had him ranked above Bob and Chris Davis last year.
Rob Pietropaula didn't and it probably won him Chris and Bob the Tournament. Moving him Down
<BR clear="left">
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b>25 Dave from Plough</b><BR>
<img src="images/caddyshack10.jpg" alt="Dave from Plough"

---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b>26 John Joe Devlin</b><BR>
<img src="images/caddyshack2.jpg" alt="John Joe Devlin"
  align="left"><BR>
<b></b>
 Even if he is a good golfer it won't matter because he will be so hammered
 by the 5th hole that you'll wish you drafted a bag of tees instead. He says
 he won't be drinking on the course if so this is a good spot he shoots about
 110. Which at Byrne would translate to 106-108. He's Scottish and remember the
 Scots invented Golf.

<b>27 Ed Bradley</b><BR>
<img src="images/caddyshack11.jpg" alt="Ed Bradley"
  align="left"><BR>
<b></b>
Will intimidate puny opponents with his massive frame. Roache Open does not
currently steroid test players so your safe drafting him high. On
a course like Byrne Ed could help off the tee if your team is lacking power.
Just shot a 111 at John F. Byrne.

<b>28 Nick Taweel</b><BR>

<img src="images/caddyshack7.jpg" alt="Steven Pietropaula"

<b></b>
May hurt you with random loud outburts at his own players. Left Handed. Volatile.
Didn't know where to put him, he is a prodigy of sorts, capable of hitting great shots
but also capable of looking like one of worst players out there around the green. Sleeper.
Expected due date of child is August 2nd so he might not be available.

Mike Murrin's cousin, not as good of a golfer as mike,

Even more shocking than having 2 John Joe's it's having 2 Billy Bobs.
This one has to be the better of the 2 BillyBob's, and I can't believe I just
wrote that sentence. Has never played a round of golf before but he has been
taking a few lessons recently. I will leave him here until I get a scouting report
as he is going out for the first time Monday.

Hurt his trigger finger trying to do a drive by so he
may be hindered. Good chance he shoots like kevin federline, better chance he
comes dressed like him.

Looks more like Jim Breslin plays more like Brian Breslin,
this is not a good combination.

Works at best buy if your looking for a HD Plasma
he's your guy, if your looking for help on the golf course look elsewhere.
I had his brother John(My Cousin)Breslin on my Team last year and he's ahhh...how do
I say...he's not good. I am pretty sure David is alot worse.

Very Good athlete but he has never played on any golf course other than a
miniature one. Very few players can come out thier first time golfing and
not be a complete train wreck. Adam could be one of the exceptions but it's rare.
Take him late where there is little risk and hope.

 The best Irish Girl in the Tournament,
draft accordingly. Said she took some lessons which would be more lessons
than any one below her in the rankings. She does not drink so she will be way more
sober than anyone below her in the rankings. Way more. Way Way More.

Once threw up on his own back and won an award
for it. Proving that he cannot handle his liquer but is also not afraid to use it.
Will be drunk by 3rd hole, watch your back.

Hasn't played in a while, probably about high
90's to 100, with occasional long drives you can use. Has a range finder for distances and
isn't afraid to use it. Even though he hasn't played in a while i guarantee he finds a way to help the team

Hell of a baseball player got to think he is a above average player for this
tournament without even knowing a score from him.

<b>Defending Roache Open Champion. Former Winner (2008)</b>
Bob scared the bejesus out of the other teams during
his warmup shots before last years tournament so  we modified the rules for his threesome
to handicap them and they still won the Tournament. Moving him up to a drafter where we should have had him last year.
(Shoots anywhere from 77 to 95ish at Juniata(Par 65)

He could help you with seemingly random loud outburts at opposing players,
kind of like a golf goon.
