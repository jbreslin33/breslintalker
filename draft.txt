<b></b>
Just as annoying as he is good, and he is very annoying, which means he is very good.
If he is on you could easily ride him to a championship.

<b>3 Nick Prosperi</b><BR>
<img src="images/caddyshack3.jpg" alt="Nick Prosperi."
  align="left"><BR>
<b>Former Winner(2001,2005)</b>
Always drafts first and still led 2 teams to titles, 2001,2005,consistent,solid, waiting for scouting
report from nick so i can adjust. According to Tim Roache Nick is a notch above himself.
<BR clear="left">
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b>2 Jim Breslin </b><BR>
<img src="images/jimbreslin.jpg" alt="Jim Breslin."
  align="left"><BR>
<b>Former Winner(2007)</b>
 Playing well right now with half of recent rounds below 85 at
Byrne's. Moving up based on recent performance and
fact that he will not draft Jim Roache this year and
I don't want to be accused of giving myself an artificially high draft pick(which I won't be using on
Jim Roache!)
<BR clear="left">
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b>4 Tim Roache </b><BR>
<img src="images/caddyshack11.jpg" alt="Tim Roache."
  align="left"><BR>
<b>Former Winner(2000,2004)</b>
Captained 2 teams to titles,2000,2004, waiting for his scouting report on how he's shooting and
will adjust accordingly by a few spots. Recently shot an 84 at John F. Byrne(par 67) and and a 90 at
a par 70.
<BR clear="left">
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b>5 John from Glam	 </b><BR>
<img src="images/glam.jpg" alt="Bob."
  align="left"><BR>
<b></b>
Moving Big John up 15 slots based on his round
of 84 and an Eagle at John F. Byrne. Former 90's shooter has found his stroke
and is on a hot streak. Don't want to move him too high too quick but this spot
seems about right.
<BR clear="left">
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b>6 John Bauer(Cups)</b><BR>
<img src="images/johnbauer.jpg" alt="John Bauer(Cups)"
  align="left"><BR>
<b>Former Winner (2005)</b>
Will put the ball in the 'Cup' for you. Need to know how he is shooting or
if he is so I can move him up,down.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b>7 Edward O'Brien(Pony)</b><BR>
<img src="images/edobrien.jpg" alt="Edward O'Brien(Pony)"
  align="left"><BR>
<b>Former Winner (2003,2005)</b>
Lefthanded, looks like ralph macchio, has a similiar golf game. You could make an argument to
rank him higher and he still might be if he gets out at all this year.
<BR clear="left">
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b>8 Chris Davis(Wink) 	 </b><BR>
<img src="images/chrisdavis.jpg" alt="Chris Davis"
  align="left"><BR>
<b>Defending Roach Open Champion. Former Winner(2002,2003)</b>
Captained 2003 team to victory at Middletown. Makes Kenny Nolan seem cheerful,
can read greens like an idiot savant.Their is no debating Chris Davis's talent,
he has shot in the high seventies, the problem comes from him only playing
once a year now with a bad back. Probably would have difficulty scoring by himself
but is an extremely valuable best ball player even only playing once a year.
<BR clear="left">
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b>9 John Austin</b><BR>
<img src="images/caddyshack3.jpg" alt="Uncle John."
  align="left"><BR>
<b></b>
Wiley golf veteran. Moving him back based on other players
getting better and that he will probably try to draft his nephews Stepen Pietropala
and Jamie Magee(see below)
<BR clear="left">
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b>10 Rob Pietropaula </b><BR>
<img src="images/robpietropaula.jpg" alt="Rob Pietropaula."
  align="left"><BR>
<b>Defending Roache Open Champ. Former Winner (2003, 2008)</b>
Lefthanded,cocky,shaved his magic mustache. Shown on left wearing the Roache Open Trophy.
Former perrenial #2 was a first time drafter last year and came through big time by captaining
his Roache Open Team to Victory last year, moving him up accordingly. If Rob shoots in the 80's
we will move him up, right now he is shooting in the mid 90's)
<BR clear="left">
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
************************ 1st Rounders **********************<Br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b>10 Mark Dlutowski(Marky D)</b><BR>
<img src="images/caddyshack2.jpg" alt="Mark Dlutowski"
  align="left"><BR>
<b></b>
Eccentric player uses clubs from 1906, if mark has gotten out this year we will
move him up. waiting on report from Mark.
<BR clear="left">
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b>12 Robert Miller</b><BR>
<img src="images/robertmiller.jpg" alt="Robert Miller"
  align="left"><BR>
<b></b>
 His brother is a pro Golfer. This gives him
just enough pedigree to move him up from last year. Ability to hit close to
pin from 50 yards and in with nice wedge shot. Capable of shooting in the low 90's.
<BR clear="left">
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b>13 Ed Bell (Kim O'Shea's Fiance)</b><BR>
<img src="images/caddyshack8.jpg" alt="Michelle"

Kim O'Shea says he's shooting in the 90's.

<b>14 Kim O'Shea</b><BR>
<img src="images/caddyshack6.jpg" alt="Kim O'Shea"
  align="left"><BR>
<b>Former Winner(2000,2001)</b>
Shoots around a 105 at John F. Byrne from the reds but that was last years scouting
report. She has been spotted at John F. Byrne just about every week so she has been
playing. I've gotten an update from Kim and she is now shooting in the 90's.
<BR clear="left">
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b>15 Michelle Forrest</b><BR>
<img src="images/caddyshack7.jpg" alt="Michelle"
  align="left"><BR>
<b></b>
Starting playing last year but is pretty good, you will use a few of her shots atleast.
Scouting report from her friend Kim is that she is shooting in the 90's.
<BR clear="left">
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b>16 Jim Roache </b><BR>
<img src="images/jimroache.jpg" alt="Jim Roache"
  align="left"><BR>
<b>Former Winner (2000,2001,2004)</b>
Uses a 7-iron for every
shot,plays small ball, ironically also has very small balls. Stock is
dropping faster than one of his duffed tee shots. His swing looks like
a retarded, drunk monkey trying to whack his own tail with a seven iron.
At this stage of his long career he is nothing more than a specialty player.
Has no long game to speak of but has good short game around the green and in
the bedroom. I Can not believe I had him ranked above Bob and Chris Davis last year.
Rob Pietropaula didn't and it probably won him Chris and Bob the Tournament. Moving him Down
<BR clear="left">

<b>17 Dennis Nash </b><BR>
<img src="images/caddyshack9.jpg" alt="Dennis Nash"
  align="left"><BR>
<b>Former Winner(2002)</b>
If Kenny doesn't show up he's
the best Irishman in the Tourny, whatever that means. Shooting around 100 currently.
<BR clear="left">
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b>18 Paul Sholette</b><BR>
<img src="images/caddyshack10.jpg" alt="Paul Sholette"
  align="left"><BR>

Could help extra by using his engineering skills
to calculate distance using the sun,flag,ball and Pythagorean Theorem
<BR clear="left">
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b>19 Ed Bradley</b><BR>
<img src="images/caddyshack11.jpg" alt="Ed Bradley"
  align="left"><BR>
<b></b>
Will intimidate puny opponents with his massive frame. Roache Open does not
currently steroid test players so your safe drafting him high. On
a course like Byrne Ed could help off the tee if your team is lacking power.
<BR clear="left">
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b>20 Big Outside Jim</b><BR>
<img src="images/caddyshack4.jpg" alt="Robert from Glam"

Will take brake from sitting outside plough to attend tournament.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b>21 John Joe Mcsorley</b><BR>
<img src="images/caddyshack5.jpg" alt="John Joe Mcsorley"
  align="left"><BR>
<b></b>
Mike Murrin's cousin, not as good of a golfer as mike,
but much less annoying. Would possibly be in the Top Flight but we in the Top Flight
have a don't ask don't tell policy. Shockingly not the only player named John Joe
in the Tournament.
<BR clear="left">
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b>22 Mike Eckmyer</b><BR>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b>23 John Joe Devlin</b><BR>
<img src="images/caddyshack2.jpg" alt="John Joe Devlin"
  align="left"><BR>
<b></b>
 Even if he is a good golfer it won't matter because he will be so hammered
 by the 5th hole that you'll wish you drafted a bag of tees instead. He says
 he won't be drinking on the course if so this is a good spot he shoots about
 110.
<BR clear="left">
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b>24 Stephen Pietropaula </b><BR>
<img src="images/caddyshack7.jpg" alt="Steven Pietropaula"
  align="left"><BR>
<b></b>
May hurt you with random loud outburts at his own players. Left Handed. Volatile.
Didn't know where to put him, he is a prodigy of sorts, capable of hitting great shots
but also capable of looking like one of worst players out there around the green. Sleeper.
Expected due date of child is August 2nd so he might not be available.
<BR clear="left">

<b>25 Jim Campbell</b><BR>

Recluse, the Bobby Fisher of the Roache Open, Won the first 2 Roache Opens
and then disapeared like he was Kaiser Sose.

<b>27 Greg O'Connor</b><BR>

Big hitter the lama, Long, once broke his Driver

from hazards.

<b>28 Joe Wicker</b><BR>

<b>29 Jamie Magee</b><BR>
<img src="images/caddyshack11.jpg" alt="Jamie Magee"

Plays alot of Tiger Woods Golf, only problem is he'll have to use a
club instead of a joystick. Has been playing just good enough to put him ahead of
atleast 3 players right now.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b>30 Russian Steve</b><BR>

<b>31 Billy Bob McWilliams</b><BR>
<img src="images/caddyshack1.jpg" alt="Billy Bob McWilliams"

Even more shocking than having 2 John Joe's it's having 2 Billy Bobs.
This one has to be the better of the 2 BillyBob's, and I can't believe I just
wrote that sentence. Has never played a round of golf before but he has been
taking a few lessons recently. I will leave him here until I get a scouting report
as he is going out for the first time Monday.

 The best Irish Girl in the Tournament,
draft accordingly. Said she took some lessons which would be more lessons
than any one below her in the rankings. She does not drink so she will be way more
sober than anyone below her in the rankings. Way more. Way Way More.

Very Good athlete but he has never played on any golf course other than a
miniature one. Very few players can come out thier first time golfing and
not be a complete train wreck. Adam could be one of the exceptions but it's rare.
Take him late where there is little risk and hope.

Once threw up on his own back and won an award

Will be drunk by 3rd hole, watch your back.

Hasn't played in a while, probably about high

isn't afraid to use it. Even though he hasn't played in a while i guarantee he finds a way to help the team

Bob scared the bejesus out of the other teams during

to handicap them and they still won the Tournament. Moving him up to a drafter where we should have had him last year.
